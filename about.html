<p>This podcast was kind of an accident, inspired by a random ferry ride and a conversation about life on other planets (we promise we’ll explain later). It was a completely spontaneous moment, the kind of conversation you have at 4 a.m. with your best friends while sitting across a messy diner table. Or on a roof. Or downing beers in a shitty apartment parking lot.</p>
<p>And that’s what this podcast is. Unfiltered, unfastened conversations that you have with people who are on your team no matter what. It’s a space for raw possibility and the elusive moments you can never seem to capture. It might get weird, but we hope you’ll stick around for the ride.</p>
